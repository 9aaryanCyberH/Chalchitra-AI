# 🚀 Streamlit Deployment Troubleshooting Guide

## ❌ Common Issue: "Dataset Not Loaded"

If you're seeing "Dataset not loaded" when deploying your Streamlit app, follow these steps:

## 🔍 Step 1: Test Data Loading Locally

First, make sure everything works locally:

```bash
# Test the debug script
python debug_data_loading.py

# Test the Streamlit app locally
streamlit run app.py
```

## 🔍 Step 2: Test Data Loading in Streamlit Environment

Use the test script to diagnose issues in your deployment environment:

```bash
streamlit run test_streamlit_data.py
```

This will show you:
- Current working directory
- Available files
- Data file locations
- Loading success/failure

## 🛠️ Step 3: Common Solutions

### Solution 1: Check File Structure
Ensure your deployment has this structure:
```
your-app/
├── app.py
├── data_analysis.py
├── movie_recommender.py
├── data/
│   ├── movies.csv
│   └── ratings.csv
└── requirements.txt
```

### Solution 2: Use Absolute Paths
The updated `data_analysis.py` now tries multiple path strategies:
- Script-relative paths
- Working directory paths
- Fallback relative paths

### Solution 3: Check Working Directory
When deploying, the working directory might change. The updated code handles this automatically.

## 🚀 Step 4: Deploy with Confidence

### For Streamlit Cloud:
1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Connect your repository to Streamlit Cloud
3. Deploy with the main file: `app.py`

### For Local Deployment:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

### For Docker:
```dockerfile
COPY . /app
WORKDIR /app
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
CMD ["streamlit", "run", "app.py"]
```

## 🔧 Step 5: Advanced Debugging

If issues persist, check the console output for:
- File path information
- Working directory details
- Error messages

The updated code provides detailed logging to help identify the exact issue.

## ✅ Success Indicators

You'll know it's working when you see:
- ✅ Data loaded successfully!
- 🎬 Movies: X records from [path]
- ⭐ Ratings: X records from [path]

## 🆘 Still Having Issues?

1. **Check the console output** - Look for detailed error messages
2. **Verify file permissions** - Ensure CSV files are readable
3. **Check file encoding** - Ensure CSV files are UTF-8 encoded
4. **Test with sample data** - Use `create_sample_data.py` to generate test files

## 📞 Need Help?

The updated code includes:
- Better error handling
- Detailed logging
- Multiple path fallbacks
- Graceful failure handling

Run the test scripts to get detailed diagnostic information!
